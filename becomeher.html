        <li>Inner Mindset First (Because is shows Outside)</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Know your worth:</b> Stop comparing yourself. You are enough.</li>
            <li><b>Set boundaries:</b> Say no when needed. Mature people protect their time and energy.</li>
            <li><b>Speak kindly to yourself:</b> Replace "I can't" with "I'm learning."</li>
</ul>

<p>"I'm becoming the best version of myself - calm, confident, and unstoppable."</p>

<ul>
    <li>Be curious, not judgemental.</li>
    <li>Ask "why" before reacting.</li>
    <li>Do't gossip - mature people speak with purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mature girls ask:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"What can i learn from this?"</li>
    <li>"Is this helping my future self?"</li>
</ul>
<li>Speak like a 20- year- old Queen</li>
<ul>
    <li>Talk slowly and clearly. Don't rush.</li>
    <li>Say "I think" instead of "I guess."</li>
    <li>Don't overshare - confidence is quiet.</li>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <li>Instead of: "Umm, I'm not sure, maybe..."</li>
    <li>Say: "Let me think about that and get back to you."</li>
</ul>
<li>Look Confident Without saying a word</li>
    </ol>
